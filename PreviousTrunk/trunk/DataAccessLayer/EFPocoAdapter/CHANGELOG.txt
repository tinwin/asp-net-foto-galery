2008/09/25 - v1.03
	* Added wrapper for ObjectContext.ApplyPropertyChanges() to IEntitySet<T>
	* Added wrapper for ObjectContext.Detach() to IEntitySet<T>
        * Fixed handling of detached/out-of-scope entities w.r.t lazy loading 
	  and attaching to other contexts. Lazy loading outside of scope will do nothing
	  if the context had DeferredLoadingEnabled=false, otherwise will throw.
	* Added partial OnZZZCreated() methods on generated contexts, adapters and proxies.
	* Fixed code generation from EDMX.
	* EFPocoContext.EnableLazyLoading renamed to EFPocoContext.DeferredLoadingEnabled
	  to better align with Linq to SQL and EF v2.
	* Fixed adapter-POCO synchronization for complex types.

2008/09/12 - v1.02
	Fixed two bugs reported by Corey Gaudin:
		1. EFPocoContext.GetAdapterObject(entity) didn't work when entity
		was a proxy. Now making sure that every proxy is always associated with a cached adapter
		so this situation is not possible.
		2. Lazy loading was allowed for detached and Added entities. Now only enabling for Unmodified and
		modified.
	Fixed code generator to get rid of compilation warning because of unused field.

2008/09/10 - v1.01
	Fixed a bug where code generator didn't work for collections if you had not provided /ref: parameter.
	Updated DetectChanges() for collections and references to be much faster.

2008/09/09 - v1.0
	Initial release
